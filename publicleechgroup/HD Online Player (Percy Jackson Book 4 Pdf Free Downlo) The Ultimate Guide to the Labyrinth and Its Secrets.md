- **The Labyrinth**: The Labyrinth is a magical maze that changes constantly and connects to various places in the world. It was created by Daedalus, a genius inventor who was cursed by Athena to never leave his creation. The Labyrinth is the main setting of the book, as Percy and his friends have to navigate through its dangers and secrets to find Daedalus and stop Kronos.
- **Kronos**: Kronos is the leader of the Titans, the ancient enemies of the gods. He was defeated and chopped into pieces by his son Zeus, but his spirit survived and is slowly reforming in a golden sarcophagus. He is using Luke, a former friend of Percy who betrayed him, as his host body. He plans to use the Labyrinth to invade Camp Half-Blood and overthrow Olympus.
- **Annabeth**: Annabeth is Percy's best friend and possible love interest. She is a daughter of Athena, the goddess of wisdom and strategy. She is smart, brave, and loyal, but also stubborn and prideful. She has a personal connection to the Labyrinth, as she met Daedalus when she was younger and admired him. She also has a rivalry with Rachel Elizabeth Dare, a mortal girl who can see through the Mist and has a crush on Percy.
- **Grover**: Grover is Percy's other best friend and protector. He is a satyr, a half-goat half-human creature who can sense nature and emotions. He is kind, funny, and loyal, but also timid and nervous. He has a quest to find Pan, the god of the wild, who has been missing for centuries. He also has a girlfriend named Juniper, a dryad who lives in a juniper tree.
- **Tyson**: Tyson is Percy's half-brother and friend. He is a cyclops, a one-eyed giant who is often shunned by humans and gods alike. He is strong, brave, and innocent, but also naive and clumsy. He works as a forger in the underwater palace of Poseidon, Percy's father and the god of the sea. He joins Percy and his friends in their quest through the Labyrinth.
