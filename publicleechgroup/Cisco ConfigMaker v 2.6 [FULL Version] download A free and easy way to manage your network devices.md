Cisco ConfigMaker v 2.6 is a useful tool for configuring a small network of Cisco devices. However, it has some limitations and drawbacks that you should be aware of:

- It does not support all Cisco devices and features. For example, it does not support VLANs, access lists, routing protocols, etc.
- It does not check for errors or conflicts in your network configuration. For example, it does not warn you if you assign the same IP address to two devices.
- It does not update automatically when you change the settings of your devices manually. For example, if you change the hostname of a device using Telnet, it will not reflect in Cisco ConfigMaker.
- It does not provide technical support or warranty from Cisco Systems, Inc. It is provided as is and at your own risk.

If you need more advanced features and functions, you might want to use other tools such as Cisco Network Assistant, Cisco Packet Tracer, or Cisco IOS software itself.
