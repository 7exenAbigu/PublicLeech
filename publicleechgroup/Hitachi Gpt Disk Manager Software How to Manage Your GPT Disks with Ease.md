# How to Use Hitachi GPT Disk Manager Software to Overcome the 2.2TB Limitation of Windows Systems
 
If you have a Hitachi hard disk drive that's 3TB or greater, you may encounter a problem when you try to use it with your Windows system. Windows systems have a limitation of 2.2TB for hard disk drives, which means that they cannot recognize or access the full capacity of your Hitachi ultra-capacity drive. This can result in wasted space and reduced performance.

## Step 1: Download the Hitachi GPT Disk Manager software
 
The first step is to download the Hitachi GPT Disk Manager software from the official website[^1^] [^2^]. The software is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. The file size is about 18 MB and it does not require installation. You can run it directly from the downloaded file.
 
## Step 2: Launch the Hitachi GPT Disk Manager software
 
The next step is to launch the Hitachi GPT Disk Manager software by double-clicking on the downloaded file. You will see a welcome screen that explains the purpose and features of the software. Click on Next to continue.
 
## Step 3: Select your Hitachi hard disk drive
 
The software will scan your system and detect all the hard disk drives connected to it. You will see a list of all the drives and their details, such as model, size, type and status. Select your Hitachi hard disk drive that's 3TB or greater from the list and click on Next.
 
## Step 4: Choose your partitioning scheme
 
The software will ask you to choose your partitioning scheme for your Hitachi hard disk drive. You have two options: MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPT (GUID Partition Table). MBR is the default partitioning scheme for Windows systems, but it has a limitation of 2.2TB for hard disk drives. GPT is a newer partitioning scheme that supports hard disk drives larger than 2.2TB, but it requires a compatible operating system and hardware.
 
If you want to use your Hitachi hard disk drive as one massive data drive without any limitations, you should choose GPT as your partitioning scheme. However, if you want to use your Hitachi hard disk drive as a bootable drive or if your system does not support GPT, you should choose MBR as your partitioning scheme. In this case, you will only be able to use up to 2.2TB of your Hitachi hard disk drive and the rest will be unusable.
 
Choose your preferred partitioning scheme and click on Next.
 
## Step 5: Create and format new partitions
 
The software will show you a graphical representation of your Hitachi hard disk drive and its partitions. You can create and format new partitions on your Hitachi hard disk drive by using the toolbar at the top of the screen. You can also resize, move, delete or hide existing partitions by right-clicking on them.
 
If you chose GPT as your partitioning scheme, you will be able to create up to 128 primary partitions on your Hitachi hard disk drive and use its full capacity. If you chose MBR as your partitioning scheme, you will be able to create up to four primary partitions or three primary partitions and one extended partition on your Hitachi hard disk drive and use up to 2.2TB of its capacity.
 
After creating and formatting new partitions on your Hitachi hard disk drive, click on Apply to save the changes.
